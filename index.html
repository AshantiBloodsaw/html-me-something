        <article>P. Sherman</article>
        <header>early years</header>
        <p>  Young P. Sherman was born to two loving parents... that couldn't stand him.
            I mean, good Lord, you'd think he shot the family dog from the way they hated him.
            They made it a point to provide him with constant discouragement so he wouldn't get the wrong idea if they fed him or clothed him.
            Sometimes, they'd even "forget" to do so on a grounds they felt they "shouldn't have to feed it if they didn't want to."
            At school, which his parents rejoiced in, the other kids tried to involve him in their games but he wasn't athletic, tired and sluggish, 
            and he look as if he has never eaten. As this was going on, people were becoming concerned. People started questioning the parents. 
            Even though they've never hit P. Sherman, they felt raising him was a chore. He was eventually moved, but foster care was having trouble finding him
            another family. Also, the place housing him didn't really have enough room to house him either so one of the social workers decided to look after him.

        <p> P. Sherman wasn' t always on his best behavior while dealing with his new living arrangements.
            He was constantly getting into fights, mainly because some of the other kids found out he was 
            in foster care and often teased him about it. It didn't help that he had a quiet demeanor and a quick temper.
            One day, he attacked another student by choking him with a tie while simutaneously stomping on the student's fingers.
            The school had no other choice but to expell him, but it didn't end there you see, some of the other students planned
            to get revenge on P. Sherman by jumping him after school. One student caught wind of this and tried her damnedest
            to warn P. Sherman. But little did she know, P. Sherman already knew and most certainly ready.
            The students planning to attack P. Sherman waited for his Gaurdian to pick him up, proceeded to follow them to their house,
             and then camped outside until it was time for them to go home but they knew were P. Sherman lived and that was enough.
             day after day, this process was repeated, until finally. P. Sherman's Gaurdian was getting curious and questioned Sherman.
             Sherman responded with, "they're friends of mine." this didn't really sit well with Sherman's gaurdian but he had another case to get to.
             once he pulled out, all hell broke loose. the students rushed Sherman's house only to find out Sherman wasn't in the house.
              the students all met up in the living room where they all agreed to try again tomorrow but then, they heard Sherman... 
              laughing. The students rushed the door but it was somehow locked from the outside. Next thing they heard was smoke detectors going off.
              The student tried to go out the back door but, everything in that area was burning in a random fire.
              This sent the students into a frenzy as they couldn't escape from the windows either and the fire was spreading fast.
              All of the students started panicking, choking, and were trying to find some way to break the window. 
              At this point, some of the students were starting to get burned. By the time Sherman's gaurdian returned, he saw cops, firemen,
               and neighbors standing outside along with parents who've just found out their children had been burned alive.
               Sherman was immediately arrested and sentenced to jail on multiple counts of murder and arson.

        <header3>Prison</header3>
        <p>  A few years into serving his sentence, Sherman ironically rarely had any problems I guess other prisoners ain't messing with that kind of crazy either. 
            But all that peace (if you can call it that) went away when the brother of one of the victims from Sherman's fire got sent 
            to the same prison. He recognized Sherman instantly and charged him. He ran over a few prisoners, a few officers and tripped 
            on a wet floor sign. Sherman looked confused as to why this random teenager just tried to attack him. After picking up the teenager and hauling him
            back to his cell, a few of the prisoners didn't take to kindly to being ran into by the young teen.
            When it was lunch time, some prisoners surrounded the teenager and poucned on him. The young teen was getting punched, kicked, stomped, and spat on.
            Sherman jumped in to fight off the prisoners jumping the teenager. The gaurds eventually broke up the fight, Sherman extended his hand
            to help the teen up but the teenager spat in his face and sat still until the gaurds grabbed him and Sherman.
